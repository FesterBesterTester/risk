The game of Risk is played with two or more players on a map. The object of the
game is for a player to defeat the other players on the map. Players take turns
advancing their armies or attacking other countries.

During their turn, a player chooses one of their occupied countries and a
neighbouring country. If a neighbouring country is occupied then the player
will attack, otherwise the player will move armies into the unoccupied country.
A player may only move or attack from an occupied country with two or more
armies. During a turn a player can move or attack as many times as they wish.

At the end of their turn, a player is rewarded a number of additional armies.
They can place these armies in any of their occupied countries.
