# Hexgrid

## The game

The game is played in-turn by two or more players on a hexgrid.

During their turn, a player chooses one of their countries and a neighbouring
country. If the neighbouring country is occupied, then the player will attack
that country. Otherwise, the player will move armies into the neighbouring
country.
